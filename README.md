# Horiseon

## Description 

In this assignment we are given code to clean up and make sure that it is segmented correctly by using semantic tags. As a beginner coder this was a challenging task but was an enjoyable one. As I practiced and spent more time trying to understand the original code, I learned how to structure a page by using semantic tags. I believe that this task mainly will prepare me for future assignments and will help me through my growing capabilities as a coder.

üèÜ The sections listed above are the minimum for a good README, but your project will ultimately determine the content of this document. You might also want to consider adding the following sections.

## Badges

Badges aren't _necessary_, per se, but they demonstrate street cred. Badges let other developers know that you know what you're doing. Check out the badges hosted by [shields.io](https://shields.io/). You may not understand what they all represent now, but you will in time.

## Features

If your project has a lot of features, consider adding a heading called "Features" and listing them there.

## Contributing

If you created an application or package and would like other developers to contribute it, you will want to add guidelines for how to do so. The [Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/) is an industry standard, but you can always write your own.

## Tests

Go the extra mile and write tests for your application. Then provide examples on how to run them.
