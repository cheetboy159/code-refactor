# Horiseon

## Description 

In this assignment we are given code to clean up and make sure that it is segmented correctly by using semantic tags. As a beginner coder this was a challenging task but was an enjoyable one. As I practiced and spent more time trying to understand the original code, I learned how to structure a page by using semantic tags. I believe that this task mainly will prepare me for future assignments and will help me through my growing capabilities as a coder.
